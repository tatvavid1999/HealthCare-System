# HealthCare-System

The Patient Monitoring System will be characterized as a system used to monitor
physiological signs including parameters such as an electrocardiogram (ECG),
respiratory signs, invasive and non-invasive blood pressure, bodytemperature, and
room temperature and humidity. Understanding and validating the monitoring
system is an innovation at Mhealth, can be called mhealth or mobile health. This
system is used for medical and general care using cell phones. These watch frames
can be used locally or remotely. Monitoring of patient relates to various situations
in which patient has a comorbid condition. It is basically a multi parameter monitoring system.

Multi parameter monitoring system: This system is utilized for
checking different crucial physiological indications of patients by transmitting the
fundamental data like ECG, breath rate and blood pressure, and so on.
Because of these reasons, multiparameter observing system holds a huge part in the
field of medicinal devices.
